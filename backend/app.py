"""
Flask backend for the TON Trivia Battle mini app.

This server hosts the static frontend files and exposes simple JSON
endpoints for retrieving trivia questions and recording match results.
You can run this locally for testing or deploy it to a cloud service.

Run with:

    pip install flask
    python app.py

Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser. When deploying, be sure
to configure HTTPS and update the `frontend/tonconnect-manifest.json` and
`frontend/index.html` files with your real domain.
